AnsibleConstants:
hold project & artifacts dirs and playbook name.
change if testing.

Main:



PlaybookRunner:
executes the command to run the playbook with the uuid and host parameters

AnsibleProcessor:
* playHasEnded(): successful run ends with "playbook_on_stats" event. 
* artifactHandler: continues to process the events until it reaches the final event or 'till timeout was reached.
* processEvents: 
	- get the events sorted numerically- only events that haven't been handled yet.
	- return if jsonfile is not valid
	- log each task's name,
	- log each task's output whether succeeded or failed.
	- the log contain all of the needed output, and currently saves in 2 places:
		1. host_deploy.log under the specific artifact dir (this is a temp file - more comfortable for debugging etc. will be removed in the project)
		2. under the path ansible-runner-service-project/host-deploy-logs
		   currently has the uuid & timestamp as its name- will be changed.

* initially was implemented using watch service, but some issues were raised such as-
using CREATED events didn't recognize the new events (were already created)
using MODIFIED listed the events multiple times for each change (including metadata), and made it much more complex to handle.
